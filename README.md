## WORDS COLLECTION: A DESCRIPTION

Welcome to my application! It allows for users to log in if they have an account and create one if they don't. Once they're logged in, the fun begins! 

Signed in users can create as many words as they want. Think of it like a personal dictionary filled with your favorite words -or maybe just words that you want to keep handy-. Once the words are created, users can delete and edit them as they please with just a few clicks. 

Signed in users can also change their passwords and sign out whenever they want -of course, with the option of signing back in-.

The reason that I decided to create this specific app is that I absolutely love words, so what could be better than being able to have your personal collection with the ones you choose?
